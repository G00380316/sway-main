LanguageTool detects many errors that a simple spell checker cannot, such as grammar issues, commonly confused words, and punctuation oversights. Additionally, LanguageTool offers style suggestions to elevate your writing: synonym replacements for overused words, concise rephrasing of wordy sentences, and formal alternatives to commonly used expressions.\n\nLanguageTool is designed with simplicity in mind, instantly analyzing your text as you type. It is compatible with most platforms, including social networks such as X/Twitter and LinkedIn, and e-mail services such as Gmail.\n\nWith LanguageTool, our aim is to give users a full-feature grammar checker and proofreader that will enable them to have control and confidence over their content. While LanguageTool is a vital extension for non-native speakers, it also recognizes many mistakes that are frequently made by native speakers. This grammar and spelling correction works across several varieties of commonly spoken languages, and is capable of distinguishing between American and British English. LanguageTool also features a personal dictionary for exceptions or words that you might commonly use, but are not found in a conventional dictionary; it will learn to recognize these words for future grammar checking and proofreading.\n\nUnlike other services like Grammarly (a.k.a. Grammerly :-), QuillBot, and Ginger, LanguageTool supports more than 25 languages including English, Spanish, French, German, and Polish (see below for the complete list).\n\nYour privacy is important to us: By default, this extension will check your text by sending it to languagetool.org over a securely encrypted connection.
